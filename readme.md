### About my project:

The name of my game is yet to be determine, but it will be inspired by two top selling arcade games from the 80s.

Kabbom is one of my old-time favorite games. It’s an arcade-1980s game made by Activision for Atari. The principal of the game is that the player have to catch objects coming down from the top of the screen and avoid missing a catch. Missing a catch means that the game is over.

The creators of Kabbom got their inspiration from another arcade game named Lost Luggage, where characters have to catch luggages thrown by a crazy Luggage carousel.

My game is going to be a take or a version of these two games. It will have objects randomly falling from the top of the screen down (or from the left or right side of the screen), and the player has to catch them avoiding missing a catch. Missing a catch is determined by the thrown object reaching the other side of the screen.

The game will have levels of difficulty, from easiest to more difficult. This difficulty will be expressed by how fast objects appear and fall down from the top of the screen, challenging the player to act fast.

There is no way to choose a level. The player has to start from level 1 and make its way up the levels on the game. Each level is timed or measured by the number of objects caught (still to be determined) so that a level can be completed, scored, and passed to the next.

The player scores every time he/she catch an object, as well as when he/she goes up one level. Score history is saved so that players can see the top player.

### Initial thoughts on game structure

The graphics and images of the game will be inspired by the Super Mario Bros. game. It will be a 2D game that will be played either horizontally or vertically. The player, for example, is at the bottom of the page moving left to right catching objects that are thrown down randomly from anywhere on the top of the screen from left to right as well. Most objects have to be caught, but a few aren’t to be catch because can take points away from the player.

I am thinking of using html5 canvas to draw dynamically on the screen, but I will test this to see if the technology is appropriate for the game and my skill level.

I anticipate challenges at using javascript classes and objects to structure my game, yet that’s my goal.


### Phases of Completion

Most necessary:
A welcome page with a start or display-instructions button.
An instruction page
An enter-player-name page with start button
A score board and a timer at the top of the screen when players are playing the game.
A screen displaying the score and a button to restart or quit the game after game is over

Add-ons;
A screen to mark the passing from one level to the other.
Sound effects to signal catching, throwing, and/or game over/game begins.
