# Project 1: Game
## Arcade retro game Kaboom/Lost Luggage


### About my project:

I developed Unit Collector as part of the first-three-week curriculum requirement for the Web Development Immersive (WDI)/ NYC Tech Talent Pipeline (TTP) Fellowship at General Assembly.

I was inspired to create Unit Collector from nostalgia for arcade games and the need to create something 2D. So, I thought of one of my old-time favorite games, Kaboom.

Kaboom is an arcade 1980s game made by Activision for Atari. The principal of the game is that a player has to catch objects falling down from the top of the screen and avoid missing a catch. Missing a catch means that the looses an opportunity.

Unit Collector is going to be a version/replication of that game. It will have objects randomly falling from the top of the screen down, and the player has to catch these objects avoiding missing a catch. The player scores every time he/she catches an object.

The technologies I use to develop Unit Collector are HTML forms, CSS animations, JavaScript classes, and jQuery selectors and methods.

### Initial thoughts on game structure

The graphics and images of the game will be inspired by the Super Mario Bros. game. It will be a 2D game that will be played either horizontally or vertically. The player, for example, is at the bottom of the page moving left to right catching objects that are thrown down randomly from anywhere on the top of the screen from left to right as well. Most objects have to be caught, but a few aren’t to be catch because can take points away from the player.

I am thinking of using html5 canvas to draw dynamically on the screen, but I will test this to see if the technology is appropriate for the game and my skill level.

I anticipate challenges at using javascript classes and objects to structure my game, yet that’s my goal.


### Phases of Completion

Phase 0:
- Draw on paper the main game screen
- Wireframming
- Source digital images

Phase 1:
- Create a directory of assets: css, js, images
- Make a static layout of the game on the browser:
- CSS styling - writing CSS file

Phase 2:
- Start a javascript file
- Add basic functionality of motion to main characters
- Add secondary characters

Phase 3:
- Determine each characters’ data type. Some may benefit from being js classes while others objects literals, or arrays, simple variables …?
- Develop more complex javascript functionality, such as the deploying of objects to be catch, and how the player would catch the object.

Phase 4:
- Testing and adjustments
- Add additional screens and sound effects

Most necessary:
- A welcome page with a start or display-instructions button.
- An instruction page
- An enter-player-name page with start button
- A score board and a timer at the top of the screen when players are playing the game.
- A screen displaying the score and a button to restart or quit the game after game is over

Add-ons:
- A screen to mark the passing from one level to the other.
- Sound effects to signal catching, throwing, and/or game over/game begins.
