# Project 1: Game

## About my project:

![project1 screenshot image](https://github.com/FelipeAtGA/Unit-Collector/blob/master/img/homescreenScreenshot.png)

I developed Unit Collector as part of the first-three-week curriculum requirement for the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline (TTP)/Web Development Immersive (WDI) Fellowship at General Assembly.

I was inspired to create Unit Collector from nostalgia for arcade games and the need to create something 2D. So, I thought of one of my old-time favorite games, Kaboom.

Kaboom is a 1980s arcade game made by Activision for Atari. The principal of the game is that a player has to catch objects falling down from the top of the screen and avoid missing a catch. Missing a catch means that to loose an opportunity.

Unit Collector is going to be a version/replication of that game. It will have objects randomly falling from the top of the screen down, and the player has to catch these objects avoiding missing a catch. The player scores every time he/she catches an object.

The technologies I use to develop Unit Collector are
* HTML5
* CSS3 animations
* JavaScript objects, and
* jQuery selectors and methods.

Unit Collector can be adapted to any theme, which is going to be, most likely, the next steps on the development of this game.

### Phases of Completion

Phase 0:
- Draw on paper the main game screen
- Wireframming
- Source digital images

Phase 1:
- Create a directory of assets: css, js, images
- Make a static layout of the game on the browser:
- CSS styling - writing CSS file

Phase 2:
- Start a javascript file
- Add basic functionality of motion to main characters
- Add secondary characters

Phase 3:
- Determine each characters’ data type. Some may benefit from being js classes while others objects literals, or arrays, simple variables …?
- Develop more complex javascript functionality, such as the deploying of objects to be catch, and how the player would catch the object.

Phase 4:
- Testing and adjustments
- Add additional screens and sound effects

Most necessary:
- A welcome page with a start or display-instructions button.
- An instruction page
- An enter-player-name page with start button
- A score board and a timer at the top of the screen when players are playing the game.
- A screen displaying the score and a button to restart or quit the game after game is over

Add-ons:
- A screen to mark the passing from one level to the other.
- Sound effects to signal catching, throwing, and/or game over/game begins.
